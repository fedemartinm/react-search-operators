# Highlighting example

Highlighting demostration! Search operators highlighted on searchbar

### Try some example:
- ```term1 term2 term3```
- ```+include -exclude "this phrase"```
- ```+👍 -👎```

> Highlighting syntax in a text-area is an expensive thing and React Search Operators does not support syntax highlighting out of the box. However, we can do this using DraftJS and ```tokenized``` output.
